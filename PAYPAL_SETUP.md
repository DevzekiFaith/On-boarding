# üéØ PayPal Payment Setup Guide

Your FreelanceHub wallet now uses PayPal instead of Stripe for seamless payment processing and withdrawals!

## üöÄ Quick Setup Steps:

### 1. Create `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Firebase Configuration (already working)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyCPgqop5Yhz7S3rvH7QVfZpQSYtDNoYjfs
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=onboarding-3eb95.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=onboarding-3eb95
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=onboarding-3eb95.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=8088933730
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:8088933730:web:2fa7c9641ef2eb7c48483b

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development

# PayPal Configuration - ADD THESE
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id_here
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_paypal_client_secret_here
```

### 2. Get Your PayPal Keys:

1. **Sign up for PayPal Developer Account**: Go to https://developer.paypal.com
2. **Create a New App**: 
   - Go to "My Apps & Credentials"
   - Click "Create App"
   - Choose "Default Application" and "Sandbox" for testing
3. **Get Your Keys**:
   - Copy the **Client ID** (starts with `A...`)
   - Copy the **Client Secret** (starts with `E...`)
4. **Replace the placeholder values** in your `.env.local` file

### 3. For Development/Testing (Temporary Fix):

If you want to test the app without PayPal payments right now, you can use these test values:

```bash
# Temporary test values (payments won't work but app won't crash)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=test_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=test_client_secret
```

### 4. Restart Your Development Server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
